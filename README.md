## Installation

### Arch Linux

Install from the AUR with your preferred AUR helper:

```bash
paru -S elio
```

### Fedora

Enable the COPR repository and install with `dnf`:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable miguelregueiro/elio
sudo dnf install elio
```

### Debian and Ubuntu-based Linux

Configure the official apt repository and install with `apt`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elio-fm.github.io/elio-apt/install.sh | sudo sh
sudo apt install elio
```

Manual repository setup is available in [`elio-apt`](https://github.com/elio-fm/elio-apt). To install without adding a repository, download `elio_amd64.deb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/elio-fm/elio/releases/latest).

The apt repository currently publishes `amd64` packages.

### Homebrew

Install from the Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install elio-fm/elio/elio
```

### Cargo

Install from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install elio
```

`elio` starts in your current working directory by default. Pass a directory path to start there instead, for example `elio path/to/directory`.

> [!TIP]
> Recommended: use a Nerd Font in your terminal so icons display correctly.

## Image Previews

Inline visual previews, including images, covers, thumbnails, and rendered pages, work automatically on supported terminals.

| Terminal | Protocol | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) | Kitty Graphics Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) | Kitty Graphics Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) | Kitty direct-placement protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) | iTerm2 Inline Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) | iTerm2 Inline Protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) | Kitty direct-placement protocol | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) | Sixel | ✓ Auto-detected |
| [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) | Sixel | ✓ Auto-detected |
| Alacritty | — | Not supported |
| Other | Kitty Graphics Protocol | Set `ELIO_IMAGE_PREVIEWS=1` to enable |

> Sixel terminals can render large or first-time previews more slowly than Kitty Graphics or iTerm2 Inline backends.
>
> In Konsole, inline previews are temporarily cleared while modal popups are open to avoid rendering artifacts.

Useful environment variables:

<details>
<summary><strong>Environment Variables</strong></summary>

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|

| `ELIO_ZOXIDE_OPTS` | Extra options appended to the zoxide interactive picker options |
| `ELIO_DEBUG_PREVIEW` | Log image preview activity to `elio-preview.log` in the system temp directory |
| `ELIO_LOG_MOUSE` | Log raw mouse events to `elio-mouse.log` in the system temp directory |

## Preview Coverage

elio previews many file types directly in the Preview pane:

- Text, source code, Markdown, logs, and structured data such as JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV/TSV, and SQLite
- Documents such as PDFs, ebooks, Office files, OpenDocument files, and Apple Pages
- Images, audio, and video metadata, with inline images, covers, and thumbnails when supported
- Folders, archives, comic archives, torrents, ISO images, and other disk-image-style containers
- Binary files with useful metadata when no richer preview is available

Some richer previews require optional system tools such as Poppler, FFmpeg, resvg, 7-Zip, unar, or FontForge.

See the preview docs:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/previews/

---

## Optional Preview Tools

elio works out of the box, but a few external tools enable richer previews for specific file types:

- `poppler` for PDF previews
- `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` for media metadata and thumbnails
- `resvg` for SVG previews
- `7z` / `unar` for archive previews
- `fontforge` for font previews

See the full optional tools list and package names in the docs:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/optional-tools/

---

## Using elio over SSH

elio works well over SSH for navigation, file operations, text/code previews, and terminal-based workflows.

Rich visual previews depend on the remote host and the local terminal:

- Text and code previews work normally.
- Images, PDF pages, video thumbnails, album art, SVG previews, and archive extras need terminal image support plus optional preview tools installed on the remote host.
- Terminal apps opened through `Open With` run inside the SSH session.
- System openers such as `Enter`, `o`, `open`, `gio`, `xdg-open`, or `cmd /c start` use the remote host's opener stack. From an SSH session, they may open on the remote host, fail, or do nothing useful.

---

## Workflow

elio supports common file-manager actions directly from the keyboard:

- `Enter` opens folders or selected files with the system default application.
- `O` opens files through the Open With flow when supported, including terminal apps.
- `c` copies names, paths, or directory paths using OSC52 or the platform clipboard.
- `g` opens quick jumps for common locations such as Home, Downloads, config, and Trash.
- `d` moves files to Trash; `D` deletes permanently; in the Trash view, `d` also deletes permanently and `r` restores.
- `f` searches folders, while `Ctrl+F` searches files in the current tree.
- `z` jumps through zoxide history when `zoxide` is installed.
- `!` opens a shell in the current folder and returns to elio when the shell exits.

Platform details vary for clipboard tools, trash backends, file openers, and shell selection. See the workflow docs:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/workflow/

---

## Change Directory on Quit

elio can leave your shell in the directory you were browsing when you quit:

```bash
elio shell install
```

Restart your shell, then run `elio` normally. Press `q` to quit and move your shell to elio's final directory, or `Q` to quit without changing directories.

See the shell integration docs for uninstall steps, supported shells, and manual setup:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/shell-integration/

---

## Configuration

elio reads configuration from:

| Platform | Config file |
|---|---|
| Linux / BSD | `~/.config/elio/config.toml` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/elio/config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/elio/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\elio\config.toml` |

See [`examples/config.toml`](examples/config.toml) for an annotated example, or the configuration docs:
https://elio-fm.github.io/docs/configuration/

---

## Theming

elio themes are TOML files layered on top of the built-in defaults, so you only need to set the keys you want to change.

| Platform | Theme file |
|---|---|
| Linux / BSD | `~/.config/elio/theme.toml` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/elio/theme.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/elio/theme.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\elio\theme.toml` |

See [`assets/themes/default/theme.toml`](assets/themes/default/theme.toml) for the full default theme and [`examples/themes/`](examples/themes/) for ready-made themes.

For transparent or terminal-palette setups, see [`examples/themes/transparent/theme.toml`](examples/themes/transparent/theme.toml) and [`examples/themes/terminal-ansi/theme.toml`](examples/themes/terminal-ansi/theme.toml).
