## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycling and the active highlight for symlinked Places entries, which previously reset to Home after opening the symlink target. ([#109])

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added Linux desktop entry metadata and hicolor application icons for packaged installs, allowing desktop launchers to discover elio as a terminal file manager. ([#67])
- Added `amd64` Debian package assets and official apt repository publishing for Debian/Ubuntu installs, including the Linux desktop entry and hicolor application icons in the package.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added a configurable `z` shortcut for jumping to directories with `zoxide query -i`, excluding the current directory from the picker and reporting missing zoxide, empty history, or history containing only the current directory clearly. ([#103])
- Added `"none"` (alias: `"transparent"`) as accepted color values in `theme.toml`, resetting foreground or background colors to the terminal default. For background fields, this lets transparent terminals show through. See `examples/themes/transparent/theme.toml`. ([#86])
- Added a `chip_text` palette field that controls the foreground of toolbar status chips (yank, cut, selected, trash, restore). Defaults to `#0c0c0c` on all themes; previously this color was reused from `chrome`. ([#86])

### Changed

- Improved chip text contrast on the bundled light themes (`default-light`, `blush-light`) as a side effect of the new `chip_text` palette field — chips now use a dark default fg instead of the theme's light chrome color. ([#86])
- Improved Kitty and Ghostty image preview auto-detection inside tmux when tmux hides the usual terminal environment markers. ([#70])

### Fixed

- Auto-enable tmux `allow-passthrough` for image previews in supported terminals, so users no longer need to configure it manually.
- Fixed Sixel preview support inside tmux, including Foot and Windows Terminal detection from tmux client/session environment. Windows Terminal now uses tmux's native Sixel path to avoid corrupted alternate-screen rendering in WSL. ([#70])
- Fixed undersized Windows Terminal Sixel previews on WSL outside tmux by querying the terminal cell pixel size before falling back to default cell dimensions.
- Fixed iTerm inline preview transport and placement inside tmux, including correct pane-relative positioning and compact cached payloads for large JPEG/GIF previews that could otherwise lag or disappear. ([#70])
- Fixed Kitty direct-placement preview transport and placement inside tmux for Konsole and Warp. ([#70])

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Added an optional startup directory argument, so `elio <directory>` opens that directory and invalid or non-directory paths return a clear error.
- Added keyboard-driven preview scrolling that mirrors `[` / `]`: `Shift+K` / `Shift+J` (configurable) step pages on PDF, comic, and EPUB previews and otherwise scroll the preview up / down. `[` / `]` now also scrolls text/code/log previews while keeping its page-step behavior on paged previews. ([#79])
- Added a dedicated Preview section to the help overlay (`?`) listing the new vertical scroll keys, `[` / `]` page-stepping, and the horizontal scroll keys, and rebalanced the overlay columns so both sides end at the same height.

### Changed

- Changed the default horizontal preview scroll bindings from `<` / `>` to `Shift+H` / `Shift+L` so all four preview scroll directions share a consistent vim-style modifier pattern. Existing `scroll_preview_left` / `scroll_preview_right` overrides in `config.toml` continue to work unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed Linux/BSD default-app dispatch and Open With MIME detection to prefer GLib's MIME resolution before falling back to `xdg-open` or `xdg-mime`, keeping system default launches aligned with desktop MIME associations. ([#77])
- Fixed Warp inline image and PDF previews by using Kitty direct placement instead of Kitty Unicode placeholders. ([#75])
- Fixed tmux relaying of Kitty Graphics preview sequences so inline image and PDF previews can render inside tmux when `KittyGraphics` is selected and `allow-passthrough` is enabled. Some tmux setups may still require preserved terminal markers or `ELIO_IMAGE_PREVIEWS=1`. ([#74], [#70])

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Added Konsole inline image preview support with a dedicated backend and conservative popup clearing to avoid preview artifacts.

### Fixed

- Fixed `cargo install elio` from crates.io by upgrading `lofty` from the yanked `0.23` series to `0.24`. Thanks @jprobichaud for catching this in [#66].

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Added QML source file support with syntax-highlighted code previews.
- Added a dedicated QML file icon in the built-in browser theme.
- Added metadata previews for TrueType, OpenType, WOFF, and WOFF2 font files, replacing the generic binary fallback.

### Changed

- Improved large-directory navigation responsiveness by deferring browser directory counts and recursive directory totals until navigation settles, canceling stale directory reload work, and scaling polling reload cadence with directory size.

### Fixed

- Fixed compact file browser rows so folder item counts and file sizes stay visually aligned across singular/plural counts and differing size units.
- Fixed browser license icons so canonical license files, SPDX-marked text files, and standalone license documents keep the license appearance during fast-path row rendering.
- Fixed truncated directory previews so sampled entry counts are no longer shown as exact totals before background directory stats finish loading.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Added RAR archive previews using the existing external archive listing backends, with `unrar` as an additional fallback when available.
- Added non-image comic archive previews for CBZ and CBR files, using embedded XML/comment metadata or conservative structured-name fallbacks instead of showing an empty pane.
- Added MOBI and AZW3 ebook classification, book icons, native metadata previews, and cover image previews for Kindle ebook files.

### Changed

- Improved fuzzy search indexing and filtering responsiveness for large directory trees.
- Simplified document metadata previews by keeping author, dates, application, stats, and extra metadata fields in the `Details` section.
- Made MOBI and AZW3 cover previews larger while preserving room for document details.
- Made full-height EPUB image sections advance on preview scroll without first scrolling hidden context lines.
- Kept RAR archive loading previews silent while archive contents are inspected in the background.
- Documented fuzzy search scope, hidden-file handling, pruning, refresh behavior, and large-tree caps.
- Documented Trash behavior across Linux, BSD, macOS, and Windows.
- Prefer `gio trash` on Linux before falling back to the Freedesktop Trash layout for desktop-compatible trashing.

### Fixed

- Fixed fuzzy search reusing stale indexes after directory reloads, so pasted, cut, deleted, or newly created entries are reflected after filesystem changes.
- Fixed Freedesktop Trash entries with collision-suffixed storage names, such as `photo.jpg.2`, so they display, preview, open, and restore using their original `.trashinfo` names.
- Fixed stacked browser layouts so the Preview pane expands in tall narrow terminals and respects configured Files/Preview pane weights.
- Fixed metadata previews for large ZIP-based office documents, including PPTX, PPTM, ODP, DOCX, XLSX, and Pages files.
- Clarified document metadata preview sections by replacing the repeated `Document` body heading with `Details` and keeping `People` for author fields.
- Fixed fixed-layout EPUB pages without extractable text so the preview shows page and book context instead of an empty pane.
- Clarified media and binary metadata previews by using `Details` instead of repeating `Video`, `Audio`, `Image`, or `Binary` as the first body section.
- Clarified archive metadata previews by using `Details` instead of `Summary`, `Image`, or `Torrent` for the first body section.
- Clarified SQLite database previews by using `Details` for the first metadata section.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Added `--help`/`-h` and `--version`/`-V` CLI flags.
- Added release packaging automation for AUR, Fedora COPR, and Homebrew, including Homebrew bottle publishing.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Inline image previews for supported terminals through Kitty Graphics, iTerm2 Inline, and Sixel backends.
- Keyboard and mouse navigation, list and grid views, and fuzzy search for efficient browsing.
- Configurable Places, theme overrides, pane layout settings, and browser key bindings.
